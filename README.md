# Location-based augmented reality visualization of 3D models using a mobile application
## Master Thesis - Roberto Coviello
This master thesis presents izanagiXR, a location-based AR application for visualizing virtual content in the physical environment. This prototype proposes an alternative to construction spans in construction projects. The aim is to accurately and persistently geolocate locations where users want to visualize 3D content.
